  <div class="tiger">

    <h2>Tiger (Goonchew)</h2>


    <p class="p">Tiger is a loyal warrior and someone who will have your back, unless yall playing
      videogames, then you getting roasted. Growing up with Tiger gave me my first friend,
      and origional member of the pirates meeting. I am thankful for all 4ft1 of you.
      Behind his strict face, he is has a heart of gold and is a true leader. Merry
      Christmas Goonchew</p>

  <div class="sammy">

    <h2>Sammy SquarePants</h2>
    <p class="p">If you've seen spongebob then you have a pretty good idea about who Sammy is. Sammy
      is a class clown minus the funny part. All jokes aside sammy has a good heart and a hard
      head. If you ever need a energy booster, Samuel L Jackson is your guy. Whether hes roasting your
      fortnite gameplay or chefing up some food, you always know its him because of his outdoor voice.
      (He never watched barney i guess). Proud of you brotha and all the great things you will accomplish.
      We will probably see you scoring a touchdown for the Seahawks. You are probably reading this with five
      less teeth.

  <div class="abel">
    <h2>Abelina</h2>

    <p class="p">Abel is the bfg (big friendly giant). His dance moves came straight out of "You got served".
      Whenever you're feeling down, gwabel will change that real quick. He specializes in zombies and
      going 0 to 100 real quick. One day he might be taller than me but until then you still the lil homie. Abel
      will probably win a nobel peace prize once he gets over his anger management. Merry Christmas you dark chocolate
      goofball.
